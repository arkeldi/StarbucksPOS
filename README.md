# Starbucks POS

GitHub repo for Starbucks POS system

- üí¨ StarbucksPOS (found here: https://msc-starbucks-site.onrender.com/) is a project that four other programmers and I worked on to develop a comprehensive Point of Sales (POS) system specifically designed for Starbucks. The focus of this project was on product/menu customization and sales tracking. To accomplish this, we leveraged product IDs to manage inventory and analyze employee performance effectively.

- The main objective of the point of sale system is to be able to start, order, and complete an order which was done completely and works accurately when completing this ordering process on the product. The manager reports that show the excess report, what sells together report, x report, etc. also look extremely appealing for the managers/owners to easily understand what every report is saying in order to understand what is going correctly, incorrectly, and how to improve their restaurant. 
  
- To enhance the system's functionality, I developed and integrated backend RESTful APIs. This significant upgrade facilitated a seamless connection to the frontend user interface, thereby optimizing user experience. Further improvements to the user experience were made by incorporating accessibility features into the system, which included adjustable font size, contrast/brightness settings, and compatibility with screen readers.
  
- Throughout the project, we utilized Agile methodology and GitHub Projects, which proved highly effective for project management and task organization. This efficient management approach ensured that all tasks were completed timely and systematically, leading to the successful completion of the comprehensive POS system.
